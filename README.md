# Wine Quality Prediction
The project was to do classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones) I found it as Regression problem and solved it using Regression model and got 67% accuracy and also tried with classification model which gave me 61 % accuracy.
